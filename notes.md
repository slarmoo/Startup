## Git and Github
From this assignment, I learned how to use github and git. I had never used either before, so this was all completely new. 
I learned about pushing and pulling (basically saving and syncing), merging conflicts, and the README.md and LISCENSE files. 

## HTML
blocks and inlines:
Spans create blocks inline, divs create blocks out of line
\<p\>\<span\>\</span\>\</p\> \<div\>\</div\>
